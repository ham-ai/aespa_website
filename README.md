Hello there! This is a little website i made from a design that i saw on Dribbble, i like to go there and search for some references then try to build them (give them live), so here it is!

The design was made by Rafli Ahmad Zulfikar Nurushiyam.
All credits to him, this project has no commercial purpose.

Here it's the working landing page that i made: [https://ham-ai.github.io/aespa_website/](https://ham-ai.github.io/aespa_website/)
